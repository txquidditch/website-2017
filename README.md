========= TEXAS QUIDDITCH WEBSITE ==========

Dear future Publicty/Social Media Chairs,

I have designed this website for desktop and mobile usage. I have done my best to design the pages in such a way that the content can be easily edited by people who have never written code before. It's no drag-and-drop, but this site will be unique to TXQ.
