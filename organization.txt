FAQ
How do a join?
-- Come out to any House Practice and we'll teach you to play! If you have fun, you can talk to one of the Captains and they can add you to our group.

When are practices?
-- House Practice is Wednesday at 4:30 at Adams-Hemphill Park. For a travelling practice, contact your Captain.

What if I can't make it to practice?
You only have to attend one practice to be eligible to play in matches! We encourage you to come to as many as you can though, as they say: practice makes perfect.
